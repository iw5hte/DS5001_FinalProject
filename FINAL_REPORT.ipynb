    "### Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to choose Plato's corpus of dialogues because there are many historical, philosophical, and literary issues surrounding the dialogues that I think text analysis might help elucidate, especially because his corpus is so large and complex that it would be difficult to give your full attention to every dialogue. I thought about including the same text in multiple forms from different translators, but ultimately decided that that might introduce too much complexity for an initial foray into Plato's works. Additionally, these complexities might teach us something about the limitations and nuances of this statistical approach."

    "1. What can exploratory text analysis tell us about the authorship and timeline of the dialogues, especially based on textual similarities between the two? These are two highly contentious historical issues that lead to differing interpretations (see: George Klosko's \"What Socrates Says, and Does Not Say\")\n",
    "2. What can we learn about the limitations of our exploratory text analysis approach when examining dialogic forms?\n",
    "3. What can we learn about how Plato's thinking changed over time as he wrote?\n",
    "4. What can Plato's literary choices tell us about his philosophy? Where should we begin analysis---with the ideas he explicitly puts in Socrates' mouth, the natures of his characters, or some combination of the two? This might lead to important implications for the political theory contentions between the Straussians and the historicists, who take the second and the first approaches, respectively."

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The general subject matter of the corpus is Plato's dialogues, which typically involve Socrates, the main character, expounding philosophy through conversations with various characters in Athens. There are a few deviations, such as the Phaedo which occurs after Socrates' death. All of these dialogues were translated by Benjamin Jowett, a Victorian-era translator of Plato's dialogues. They all also include introductions and analyses by Jowett, but I chose to omit these from my analysis because I feel like they are their own separate works, and though translation inherently comes with interpretation, I am more interested in Plato's voice and writing than Jowett's.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 29 observations and the average document length (excluding Jowett's introduction) is 25476 tokens, though there is a lot of variation between dialogues. While some dialogues are easily divded into books and sections, like The Republic, Timaeus, and the Laws, many others remain one large chunk of text that cannot be separated into chapters. This means that the paragraph bag of words will typically be most useful, especially because usually the speaker in each paragraph is different."
